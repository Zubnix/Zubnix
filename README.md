### Hello there 🧔

My name is Erik De Rijcke and I'm a long time (10+ years) open-source software enthousiast. 

🔭 Currently nearly all of my spare time is invested in [Greenfield](https://github.com/udevbe/greenfield).

### Greenfield 🌱

Greenfield is a cloud computer which allows you to run all of your applications distributed remote, or locally using WebAssambly. All directly in your browser:
- Your windows: they come from the web.
- Your desktops, your screens: they run on the web.

You can find more information on the official [Greenfield website](https://www.greenfield.app)
or have a look on how it all [began](https://wayouttheresoftware.blogspot.com/2023/07/some-history-about-greenfield.html).
